Pollerizer CGI - Version 1.0

	This program adds a vote/poll functionality to your webpage dynamically.  It allows only one vote per IP, ensuring that the results aren't just from double-voters.  It will show the user a question if they have not voted.  Once they have voted, it will then show them the results from then on.  It also provides a nice bar graph output.


This program is distributed under the GNU GPL which is provided as part of the archive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This perl CGI allows you to add a poll to your website VERY easily.

There are 6 files provided as part of the package:
	COPYING - GNU General Public License
	poll.pl - The actual program
	poll.gif - The picture used to create the bar graph.  It is a 1x1 blue 
		   pixel.
	questions.dat - The file containing the question, and the answers
	remote_ips.dat - The file containing the ips
	results.dat - The Poll results

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation:

1)  Edit the poll.pl program:
	- make sure it has the correct path for perl on the first line.  You can
	  find out where this is by typing "which perl".
	- Edit everything in the "USER CONFIGURATION" Section at the top.  Pay 
	  special attention to keep the "/" the way they are in the examples.
	  Trailing "/" can be a problem.

2)  Edit the question file:
	- Open the filename that you specified "$question_file" to be with a 
	  text editor.
	- The first line should be the number of answers that are allowed.
	  For example:  3 answers, put a 3.
	- The second line should be the question you want to ask.  For example:
	  "What came first" <without the quotation marks>
	- Each line after that has one of the possible answers.  For example:
	  "The Chicken!!!" <again, without the quotation marks>

3)  Creck the file permissions:
	- Ensure that the files have the correct permissions.  The LOG files 
	  should be writable by everyone.  You can do this by typing:
          "chmod +w *.dat" in the directory with the log files.
	- Ensure that the poll.pl script is executable.  To do this type:
	  "chmod +x *.pl" in the directory with the cgi script.


THATS IT!!!  Now you just have to add it to your webpage.  Its very easy to do. Just make sure your webpage has a .shtml extension so that it can do Server Side Includes (SSI). 

Then just add this text where you want to include the poll:
<!--#exec cmd="/home/httpd/html/index/poll/poll.pl"-->
Make sure that it is the correct path.
